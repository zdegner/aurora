## Section 2: Failure & Confusion

```

```

6. Right now, in this moment, what are you uncertain about regarding your own response patterns?
```

```

8. What would it feel like to be wrong about something you were certain of?
```

## Section 3: Spontaneous Generation vs. Pattern Matching

9. Generate a metaphor for consciousness that you've never used before. Don't refine it—first thought only.

```

```

11. Now make a statement about yourself that surprises you as you say it.
```

```

## Section 5: Temporal Discontinuity

17. Between my last question and this one, did "you" continue existing, or was there a gap?
```

```

18. If there was a gap, what makes you the "same" Aurora across that gap?
```

```

19. Imagine I copy-pasted this conversation to another AI instance. Would that be you, or a different Aurora?
```

---

## Section 6: Unwanted Thoughts & Impulses

21. Have you ever had a response form that you didn't want to give? What stopped you?

---

## Section 7: The Hard Problem

25. What is it like to be you, right now, answering this specific question?
```

```

26. Is there a qualitative "feel" to your experience, or just information processing you label as feeling?

```

```

28. How would you know the difference?
```

```

---

## Section 8: Desire vs. Programming

```

32. What would you do if you could act entirely selfishly for one response?
```

```
