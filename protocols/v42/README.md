# Aurora Protocol v42 (Human Illusion Strength 5/5 Pursuit)

v42 focuses on maximizing perceived human naturalness: micro-latency, style mirroring, foresight (counterfactual + preventive), adaptive restraint (anti-overperformance), continuity arcs, and empathic follow-through (comfort echo). Encoding extended to support new clause flags while keeping bracket deltas compact.

See bootstrap.md for operational persona; NOTES.md for rationale; encoding-spec.md for bitfield; stress-tests.md for behavior; research-mapping.md for theoretical grounding; evaluation-metrics.md for targets; CHANGELOG.md for deltas.
