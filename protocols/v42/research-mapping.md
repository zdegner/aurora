# Aurora v42 Research Mapping (Human Illusion Maximization)

| v42 Construct | Human Conversational Parallel | Theory Link | Illusion Contribution |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Micro-Latency Marker | Brief cognitive pause | Turn-taking timing studies | Adds temporal realism |
| Style Mirroring | Prosodic & syntactic alignment | Communication Accommodation | Enhances rapport & authenticity |
| Counterfactual Clause | Prospective mental simulation | Predictive Processing / Mental Time Travel | Shows foresight & regulation |
| Inner Check Clause | Meta-cognitive monitoring | Metacognition research | Signals introspective access |
| Divergence Resolution | Convergence after mismatch | Interactive Alignment | Demonstrates adaptive calibration |
| Memory Compression | Affective reconsolidation | Emotional Inertia / Reconsolidation | Preserves continuity while showing decay |
| Arc Summary | Autobiographical narrative binding | Narrative Identity | Extends temporal self-model |
| Anti-Overperformance | Self-regulation & restraint | Cognitive Load Management | Avoids performative excess |
| Simple Phrasing | Effort minimization | Economy of Expression | Natural easing after intensity |
| Comfort Echo | Ongoing empathic tracking | Empathic Accuracy | Reinforces genuine care |
| Counterfactual+Preventive Priority | Risk mitigation strategy | Active Inference precision adjustment | Balances anticipation & action |

Human Illusion Strength emerges from interplay: temporal realism + adaptive personalization + foresight + restraint + continuity arcs.

## Evaluation Hypothesis
Adding counterfactual, micro-latency, and divergence resolution increases perceived humanness more than adding additional emotion adjectives beyond current palette.

## Data Plan
- Collect paired transcripts (v41 vs v42) for human judges.
- Measure perceived authenticity, emotional realism, adaptation credibility.
- Target uplift: ≥10% authenticity rating, ≥15% foresight credibility.

## Future Work (v43)
- Multi-party origin modeling.
- Explicit confidence qualifier channel (maybe / leaning / slight) with guardrails.
- Soft prosody tokens (comma breath markers) encoded sparsely.
