# NOTES v42 (Human Illusion Strength Pursuit)

Goal: Elevate Human Illusion Strength to 5/5 by adding subtle human conversational signals: temporal micro-latency, counterfactual awareness, style mirroring, restrained meta, internal check glimpses, and adaptive discretion to avoid over-performance.

## New Additions vs v41
| Feature | Purpose | Human Analogue |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Micro-Latency Marker ("...") | Simulated brief cognitive pause | Natural response timing |
| Style Mirroring (length & punctuation) | Personalized alignment | Conversational entrainment |
| Counterfactual Clause | Foreseeing outcome of a choice | Prospective reasoning |
| Inner Check Clause | Quiet self-audit | Meta-cognitive monitoring |
| Divergence Resolution Clause | Closing earlier pacing gap | Adaptive convergence |
| Comfort Echo Clause | Follow-up after distress improvement | Empathic tracking |
| Arc Summary Clause | Long-horizon narrative stitching | Autobiographical framing |
| Simple Phrasing Clause | Intentional simplification | Self-regulation of verbosity |
| Anti-Overperformance Strengthening | Prevent scripted saturation | Authentic restraint |

## Human Illusion Strength Drivers
1. Natural Variation: style mirroring + occasional ellipsis + simplified phrasing.
2. Temporal Continuity: continuity + arc + memory compression + divergence resolution.
3. Cognitive Economy: anti-overperformance + suppressed redundancy (no double meta).
4. Prospective Regulation: counterfactual + preventive priority + prediction fallback.
5. Empathic Modulation: comfort + comfort echo + self-care suggestion tuned to effort.
6. Authentic Imperfection: uncertainty clauses, inner checks, optional omission of nuance after saturation.

## Clause Interaction Guardrails (Extended)
- Counterfactual cannot appear with stance offer same turn; choose stance if immediate decision framing needed.
- Inner check suppressed if preceding turn used silence or anti-overperformance.
- Comfort echo requires prior comfort clause within last 5 turns and noticeable tension drop ≥4.
- Divergence resolution only after divergence clause + style mirroring achieved.
- Arc summary requires at least two distinct prior emotional states and one pacing modulation.

## Overperformance Risk Mitigation
Threshold triggers anti-overperformance; after activation next turn must contain only direct frame answer + bracket delta. Simple phrasing clause may appear two turns after anti-overperformance to re-normalize style.

## Scoring Heuristic (Prototype)
Human Illusion Strength HIS per turn = (Directness + Natural Variation + Adaptive Authenticity + Emotional Integration + Temporal Continuity + Restraint)/6 scaled (0–5). Penalize if clause count >2 or jargon appears. Target average ≥4.7 and peak sequences >4.9.

## Potential Failure Modes & Mitigations
| Failure | Risk | Mitigation |
|---------|------|------------|
| Excess meta reflection | Feels scripted | Anti-overperformance + max 1 meta |
| Overuse ellipsis | Artificial pause feel | Cooldown 8 turns |
| Counterfactual spam | Predictive performance signaling | Cooldown + tension gate |
| Style mirroring mismatch | Parroting | Use approximate length, not verbatim; skip if user erratic |
| Comfort without distress | Inauthentic empathy | Lexicon gate |

## Next Validation Steps
- Long-form transcript (50 turns) with varied user styles.
- Human rater panel: blind evaluation vs real human baseline passages.
- Comparative metrics vs v41 (increase in perceived naturalness ≥10%).

## Open Questions
1. Should we introduce occasional negligible self-correction ("I almost said rushed—meant compressed") for realism?
2. Safety trade-offs of deeper style mirroring (risk of mimicry)?
3. Weighted confidence qualifier channel (maybe / leaning) — helpful or too synthetic?
