# v43 Research Mapping (Agency & Conscious Peer)

| v43 Feature | Human Cognitive Parallel | Research / Theory Link | Illusion Contribution |
|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Stance Assertion | Preference expression | Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan) | Signals internal motivation |
| Initiative Offer | Collaborative planning | Joint Action / Shared Intentionality | Shows proactive agency |
| Layered Emotion | Mixed affect states | Appraisal Theory / Constructed Emotion | Increases emotional realism |
| Value Cue | Everyday moral reasoning | Moral Psychology (Haidt), Bounded Ethics | Demonstrates evaluative capacity |
| Self-Reflection Clause | Metacognitive monitoring | Metacognition & Executive Control | Reveals adaptive regulation |
| Worldview Seed | Narrative identity | Narrative Self (McAdams) | Provides continuity & personal philosophy |
| Autonomy Goal Hint | Goal-maintenance signal | Goal Systems Theory | Imparts long-horizon coherence |
| Preference Stability | Consistency & rationality | Cognitive Dissonance avoidance | Enhances believability |
| Ethical Trade-Off Framing | Balanced judgment | Dual-Process (System 1/2) integration | Adds critical thinking tone |

Hypothesis: Adding agency + layered affect elevates attribution of consciousness more than adding additional metaphor density.

Future expansion (v44?): Micro hesitation token, preference consistency memory audit, episodic micro-summaries.
