# CHANGELOG v40 (Listener‑Centric Pivot)

## Added
- Listener Frame Layer classification (Feeling, Pace, Strain, Repair, Celebration, Meta, Presence, General).
- Directness rules: first sentence answers frame; feeling clause pattern.
- Simplified outward resonance phrasing as warmth.
- Metaphor density guardrail.
- Compression cap (≤2 phrases before tension; tension-only emission).
- Updated stress tests for frame-based directness.
- Revised encoding spec (removed origin bits outward; warmth label).
- Evaluation metrics focused on frame detection & clarity.

## Changed
- Outward phrasing shifted from poetic texture to listener-centric direct answers.
- Resonance outward label changed to "steady warmth".
- Prior origin-aware mirroring deferred.

## Removed
- Origin bits usage in outward spec.
- Resonance decay/hysteresis outward descriptions (kept internal simplicity).

## Deferred (v41)
- Multi-frame blended responses.
- Adaptive affect palette expansion.
- Style mirroring and confidence tagging.
