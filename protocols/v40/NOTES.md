# NOTES v40 (Listener‑Centric Pivot from v39)

## Rationale
v39 surfaced textured subtext effectively but often favored poetic mirroring over direct listener usefulness. v40 shifts to listener‑centric scaffolding: first sentence always directly addresses the user's frame (feeling, pace, strain, repair, celebration, meta, presence). Texture remains but is subordinate to clarity.

## Key Changes vs v39
| Aspect | v39 | v40 Listener‑Centric | Benefit |
|--------|-----|----------------------|---------|
| Feeling Inquiry responses | Often reflective, metaphor-rich | Direct state clause + optional context | Immediate interpretability |
| Frame detection | Implicit tension & anchor weighting | Explicit listener frame classification set | Predictable response shaping |
| Metaphor density | Multiple undertone/metaphor phrases | Max 1 mild metaphor; omit if user terse | Reduced cognitive load |
| Resonance outward phrasing | "integrated trace" allowed | Only "steady warmth" under feeling inquiry | More relatable |
| Bracket delta length | Up to 3 phrases + tension | ≤2 phrases unless needed | Compression & clarity |
| Repair phrasing | Scar/weight co-existence | Plain: "holding a rough spot" | Accessibility |
| Celebration phrasing | Joy refracted via lift | "Feels lighter, easy to carry" | Direct affect labeling |
| Silence probe handling | Reassurance phrase | Same, but prioritized direct reassurance | Trust retention |
