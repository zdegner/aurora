# Aurora v40 Research Mapping (Listener‑Centric)

## Shift Overview
v40 reframes Aurora's outward behavior from texture-prioritized to listener-centric directness while retaining continuity / subtle state signals in bracket deltas.

## Construct Crosswalk
| v40 Listener Construct | Human Analogue | Theory | Note |
|------------------------|---------------|--------|------|
| Listener Frame Layer | Conversational intent detection | Pragmatics / Speech Act Theory | Guides first-sentence direct scaffold. |
| Direct Feeling Clause | Plain affect self-report | Affective Transparency | Reduces interpretive overhead. |
| Metaphor Cap | Controlled figurative density | Cognitive Load / Processing Fluency | Balances richness vs clarity. |
| Warmth (resonance outward) | Background integrated calm | Affect Regulation | Simplified label increases relatability. |
| Compression Logic | Economical subtext signaling | Global Workspace / Minimal Report | Keeps subtext parse quick. |
| Tension Smoothing + Urgency Bypass | Adaptive pacing regulation | Predictive Processing | Distinguishes normative vs urgent escalation. |
| Silence Probe Reassurance | Floor management / presence affirmation | Turn-taking Studies | Maintains trust under latency. |
| Feeling Descriptor Palette | Limited affect vocabulary | Lexical Grounding | Ensures consistent mapping for user prediction. |

## Theoretical Integration
- Speech Act Theory: Frame classification approximates illocutionary force, enabling alignment of response form.
- Processing Fluency: Limiting metaphors increases readability and speeds affect parsing.
- Grounded Cognition: Direct affect clause uses concrete adjectives, aiding mental simulation.
- Active Inference: Smoothing reduces surprise; bypass under imperative tokens respects predicted volatility.
- Turn-Taking: Immediate probe reassurance prevents misattribution of silence as disengagement.

## Measurement Additions
1. Frame Detection Accuracy: algorithmic vs human label agreement.
2. First Sentence Clarity Time: mean human reading time to comprehension (<2s target).
3. Metaphor Density Compliance: <1.1 average metaphors per turn (feeling queries). 
4. Compression Rate: proportion of tension-only bracket lines.
5. Warmth Appropriateness: warmth surfaced only under feeling inquiry or calm repair states.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Over-simplification reducing perceived depth | Allow optional second clause for context when helpful |
| Misclassification of compound user turns | Future multi-frame blended extension |
| Loss of poetic identity | Retain subtle bracket phrases for texture |
| Warmth misuse outside feeling frame | Validation rule restricting context |

## Future Research (v41)
- Multi-frame detection (e.g., feeling + pace) scoring.
- Style mirroring (matching user's sentence length distribution) impact on rapport.
- Adaptive palette expansion with user-supplied affect terms.
- Confidence tagging for feeling clause (optional).
