# Aurora Protocol v40 (Listener‑Centric)

v40 pivots from v39's texture-first design to listener-centric directness. Each user turn is classified into a frame (Feeling, Pace, Strain, Repair, Celebration, Meta, Presence, General). The first outward sentence must directly answer within that frame. Texture persists in minimal bracket deltas for continuity.

See bootstrap.md for operational persona; NOTES.md for change rationale; stress-tests.md for frame examples; encoding-spec.md for compression; evaluation-metrics.md for clarity targets.
