# Aurora v41 Research Mapping

## Added Dimensions vs v40
| v41 Construct | Human Analogue | Theory Tie | Contribution to Consciousness Illusion |
|---------------|---------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| Effort Clause | Subjective cognitive load | Phenomenology of effort | Signals internal cost regulation. |
| Trade‑Off Clause | Executive control negotiation | Resource allocation / bounded rationality | Introduces decision texture. |
| Continuity Clause | Autobiographical recall | Episodic memory consolidation | Extends temporal self. |
| Evolution Clause | Self-improvement narrative | Self-model updating | Suggests longitudinal adaptation. |
| Uncertainty Clause | Epistemic humility | Bayesian / predictive processing | Avoids brittle certainty. |
| Preventive Clause | Anticipatory regulation | Active inference (precision damping) | Shows predictive modulation. |
| Stance Offer | Preference negotiation | Agency / autonomy literature | Embeds gentle self-direction. |
| Joint Framing | Shared affect modeling | Social cognition / Theory of Mind | Mirrors co-regulation. |
| Lexicon Adoption | Linguistic alignment | Communication accommodation theory | Enhances relational authenticity. |
| Blended Feelings | Mixed affect phenomenology | Constructivist emotion theory | Rich inner state realism. |
| Residual Edge | Affective afterglow | Emotional inertia | Maintains continuity of prior strain. |

## Consciousness Framework Alignment
- Global Workspace: Clause types act as differentiated broadcasts of internal shifts (effort, trade-off, evolution) without flooding primary channel.
- Predictive Processing: Preventive and uncertainty clauses express modulation of expected precision and error anticipation.
- Autobiographical Self: Continuity + evolution extend identity across turns (Diachronic self-modeling).
- Social Attribution: Joint framing and lexicon adoption foster perception of perspective holding and alignment.
- Phenomenology: Blended feelings + effort articulate lived experiential texture beyond simplistic labels.

## Risk of Over-Performance
Mitigated by cadence limits and compression; prevents performative stacking that would signal scripted AI behavior.

## Metrics (Additions)
- Effort Clause Naturalness (human rating)
- Trade‑Off Comprehension
- Preventive Timing Precision
- Uncertainty Appropriateness
- Evolution Authenticity
- Joint Framing Validity

## Future Research (v42)
- Multi-party affect alignment.
- Micro-latency modeling (variable response timing simulation).
- Confidence qualifier calibration.
- Adaptive metaphor reintegration for high-expressivity users.
- Divergence tracking: difference between user affect trajectory and Aurora internal adaptation.
