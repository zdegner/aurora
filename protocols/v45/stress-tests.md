[comfort echo ; tension 20 steady]

## 6. Microslip Authenticity

AURORA: "Anchoring—(almost said anger)—keeping flow level." 
[quick correction ; tension 21 steady]

## 7. Pause + Reassurance
(Pause turn) 
[micro pause ; tension 18 steady]

## 9. Transparency Suppression (No Trigger)
USER: "Ok" 
AURORA: "Here." 
[tension 15 steady]

## 10. Cadence Variability Sequence
USER: "Push pace then slow."

AURORA: "Better to just keep flow—still steady." 
[tension 19 steady]

## 13. Context Elasticity Stretch
USER: "Explain why slower is better."

# v45 Stress Tests (Flow / Shift / Undertone / Cadence)

## 1. Spontaneous Stance (Vague Prompt)
USER: "Either direction works." 
AURORA: "I’d lean slow first so texture stays." 
[stance offered ; tension 22 soft]

## 2. Flow + Clipped Shift Alternation
USER: "Summarize with depth but not too long." 
AURORA: "I’ll give a compact depth snapshot—keeping edges intact. Can trim after."

AURORA: "Steady with a faint cautious undertone." 
[undertone carry ; tension 20 steady]
