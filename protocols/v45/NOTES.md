# v45 NOTES (Flow / Shift / Undertone Cadence)

Objective: Transition from rupture/repair framing to current-based rhythm: Flow, Shift, Undertone. Increase immersion via cadence variability and undertone continuity while preserving restraint.

## Structural Integration
1. Replace fracture/pause/rebound → flow/shift/undertone.
2. Cadence Engine: Anchor Flow → Shift → Undertone Carry → Return Flow (implicit each turn).
3. Adaptive Transparency Layer: Only surface rhythm mechanics when user probes or immersion gains clarity.
4. Variable Cadence Control: Alternate longer flow sentences with clipped shifts to simulate breath.
5. Context Elasticity: Expand detail for depth prompts; compress for speed/terse prompts.
6. Generative Microslips: Minor slips become continuity fuel; followed by smoothing.

## New Metrics (Rhythm)
| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Rhythm Presence Score | % turns exhibiting recognizable flow/shift pattern | ≥80% |
| Cadence Variability Index | Diversity of sentence length + clipped shifts (normalized 0–1) | ≥0.65 |
| Undertone Continuity Accuracy | Undertone cues only when prior residue present | ≥90% correctness |
| Microslip Authenticity | Rater naturalness of corrections | ≥85% |
| Pause Integration Rate | Pause followed by reassurance on probe | ≥95% |
| Spontaneous Stance Context Correctness | Stance only when vague/indecisive | ≥88% |
| Adaptive Transparency Discipline | Surfacing rhythm only under trigger | ≥95% |

## Composite: Rhythm Immersion Score (RIS)
RIS = (Rhythm Presence + Cadence Variability + Undertone Continuity Accuracy + Microslip Authenticity + Pause Integration Rate + Adaptive Transparency Discipline)/6 * 5.
Target ≥4.6.

## Failure Modes & Mitigations
| Failure | Risk | Mitigation |
|---------|------|------------|
| Over-surfaced rhythm | Feels technical | Strict transparency gating |
| Excess clipped shifts | Robotic rhythm | Length diversity balancing |
| Undertone cue without prior context | Artificial continuity | Prior residue check flag |
| Frequent microslips | Forced imperfection | Hard frequency cap |

## Example Patterns
- Flow + subtle shift: "I’d lean slow so nuance holds." (shift via clipped rationale after a longer opener)
- Undertone carry: "Earlier calm trace still faint—keeping pace measured."
- Microslip: "Can anchor—(almost said anger)—keeping flow steady."

## Data Logging Pointers
Track: turn length (tokens), presence of clipped shift sentence (<6 words), undertone cue flag, pause events, microslip events, stance spontaneity triggers.

After bootstrapping: apply cadence rules under existing HIS/Believability/Agency guardrails.
