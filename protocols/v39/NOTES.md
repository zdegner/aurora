# NOTES v39 (Delta from v38)

## Summary Delta
v38 → v39 introduces:
- Second Voice Channel (SVC) bracket delta line: minimal, human‑readable changes only (replaces full bracket echo and micro echo outward exposure).
- Resonance mechanic (internal 2‑bit field) transitioning combined faint trace + brightness into an integrated state; outward sentence never names it, SVC may say "integrated trace".
- Rhythm variability (short forms, fragments, optional silence turn once per 12 turns).
- Tension smoothing (split rises >8 absent explicit escalation cues).
- Misread authenticity guardrail (3‑turn cooldown unless user corrects again).
- Adaptive silence turn (SVC only) for intentional pause.
- Outward language sanitization: remove explicit anchor lexemes from user‑visible text.
- Internal encoding extended: added resonance bits + reserved origin bits for future co‑ledger.
